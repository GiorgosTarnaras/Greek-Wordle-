# Greek-Wordle-
A python app of the game wordle that uses greek words instead.
We use the urllib.request library to get the content of 
"https://sites.google.com/site/dimizaro/lexiko/lexeis5grammaton"
which has the majority of greek words of 5 letters in order and we randomly select a 
different word each time to use for the game. The game's GUI is made with tkinter.
